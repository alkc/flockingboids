# TO-DO

## High priority

* Fix up quadrants
* Implement spawnRadius in settings
* Implement killList (log of all dead boids)
	Example:	tick	genome	death-cause
* Implement proper IDs for genes  

## Medium priority

* Implement a switch to end the simulation should all boids 
  die or be reduced to a single boid. Unlikely, but it might happen.

* Document BoidGenetics
* Document BoidBehavior
* Document PredatorBehavior
* Document printers.py


## Whatever

* Look into combining boid and predator behavior
* Convert Boid and PredatorBoid to DoveBoid and HawkBoid respectively 
  and rewrite both to be extensions of a parent Boid class:
     - Current predator and boid class share a few functions in common
       and omitting their behavior they are quite similar in form and
       function.
